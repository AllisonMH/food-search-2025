## 🏗️ Technology Stack

### Frontend Technologies
- **React 19.1.1** - UI library for building interactive interfaces
- **Vite 7.1.7** - Next-generation frontend build tool
- **SCSS/Sass 1.93.2** - CSS preprocessor for maintainable stylesheets
- **React Router DOM 7.9.5** - Client-side routing
- **Leaflet 3.x + React Leaflet** - Interactive map visualization
- **Browser Geolocation API** - Location-aware features
- **localStorage** - Client-side data persistence for favorites

### Backend Technologies (Phase 2.5) 🚧
- **PostgreSQL** - Relational database for food resources
- **Express.js** - Web framework for RESTful API
- **node-postgres (pg)** - PostgreSQL client for Node.js
- **Vercel Serverless Functions** - Backend hosting
- **Vercel Postgres / Supabase** - Managed PostgreSQL database

### Why These Technologies?

**React + Vite**: Provides a fast, modern development experience with instant hot module replacement and optimized production builds.

**SCSS/Sass**: Enables maintainable, modular CSS with variables, nesting, mixins, and functions. The BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention makes styles easy to understand and modify.

**React Router**: Enables seamless navigation without page reloads, creating a smooth single-page application experience.

**Leaflet**: Open-source mapping library with excellent mobile support and no API keys required. React Leaflet provides clean React bindings for declarative map components.

**Browser APIs**: Leverages native geolocation and localStorage for zero-dependency features that work offline and respect user privacy.

## 🏛️ Software Architecture

### Component Architecture

```
App (Router)
├── Home Component
│   ├── Hero Section
│   ├── Information Section
│   └── Call-to-Action
└── FoodResources Component
    ├── Search & Filter Bar
    │   ├── Text Search
    │   ├── County Dropdown
    │   └── Zip Code Dropdown
    └── Resource List
        └── Resource Card (repeated)
            ├── Organization Details
            ├── Location Information
            ├── Contact Information
            └── Service Tags
```

### Data Flow

1. **Data Storage**: Food resources stored in `foodResources.json`
2. **Data Loading**: Imported directly into components (no backend required)
3. **Filtering**: Client-side filtering using React state and useMemo
4. **Rendering**: Dynamic rendering based on filter state
5. **Responsive Design**: SCSS with media queries handles all responsive layouts

### Key Design Decisions

**Static Data**: Using JSON instead of a database keeps the app simple, fast, and easy to contribute to. Anyone can add resources by editing a single file.

**Client-Side Filtering**: All filtering happens in the browser, making the app extremely fast and requiring no backend infrastructure.

**Mobile-First**: Starting with mobile design ensures the app works great on the devices most likely to be used by people seeking assistance.

**GitHub Pages Hosting**: Free, reliable hosting with automatic deployments from the repository.

## 📊 Data Structure

Each food resource contains:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Organization Name",
  "address": "Street Address",
  "city": "City",
  "state": "GA",
  "zipCode": "30303",
  "county": "County Name",
  "phone": "(404) 555-1234",
  "website": "https://example.org",
  "description": "Description of services",
  "latitude": "",
  "longitude": "",
  "services": ["Food Pantry", "Free Meals"],
  "hours": "Monday-Friday: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM"
}
```

If you do not know the latitude and longitude just add the food resource entry to `src\data\foodResources.json` and run `npm run coordinates` it should fill out the coordinates for you.

## 🛣️ Roadmap & Future Enhancements

### Phase 2.5: Backend Migration (In Progress) 🚧
**Moving from Static JSON to PostgreSQL + Express API**

This phase introduces a dynamic backend to enable CRUD operations, user contributions, and admin management.

**Key Features:**
- [ ] PostgreSQL database with 125+ food resources
- [ ] RESTful API with Express.js on Vercel Serverless Functions
- [ ] CRUD operations for food resources
- [ ] Admin dashboard for content management
- [ ] API endpoints for third-party integrations
- [ ] Backward compatibility with static JSON fallback

**Technology Stack:**
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Vercel Postgres / Supabase / Neon)
- **Backend**: Express.js on Vercel Serverless Functions
- **ORM**: node-postgres (pg)
- **API**: RESTful endpoints at `/api/*`

**API Endpoints** (Planned):
- `GET /api/resources` - Fetch all resources with filtering
- `GET /api/resources/:id` - Fetch single resource
- `GET /api/counties` - Get list of counties
- `GET /api/service-types` - Get service types
- `POST /api/admin/resources` - Create new resource (admin)
- `PUT /api/admin/resources/:id` - Update resource (admin)
- `DELETE /api/admin/resources/:id` - Soft delete resource (admin)

**Documentation**: See [BACKEND_MIGRATION.md](BACKEND_MIGRATION.md) for detailed migration plan, database schema, and implementation steps.

**Timeline**: 4 weeks (Database setup → API development → Frontend integration → Testing)

### Phase 3: Community Features (Planned)
- [ ] User reviews and ratings
- [ ] Real-time availability updates
- [ ] Multi-language support (Spanish, etc.)
- [ ] SMS/text message integration

### Phase 4: Data & Analytics (Planned)
- [ ] Usage analytics dashboard
- [ ] Resource utilization tracking
- [ ] Automated data validation
- [ ] API for third-party integrations

### Phase 5: Accessibility & Reach (Planned)
- [ ] Voice navigation support
- [ ] Offline PWA capabilities
- [ ] Print-friendly resource lists
- [ ] QR code generation for resources
