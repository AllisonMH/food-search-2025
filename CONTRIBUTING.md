## Adding Food Resources

### Data Format

Food resources are stored in `src/data/foodResources.json`. Each entry follows this structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Organization Name",
  "address": "123 Main St",
  "city": "Atlanta",
  "state": "GA",
  "zipCode": "30303",
  "county": "Fulton",
  "phone": "(404) 555-1234",
  "website": "https://www.example.org",
  "description": "Brief description of services provided",
  "services": ["Food Pantry", "Free Meals", "Mobile Pantry"],
  "hours": "Monday-Friday: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM"
}
```

### Required Fields
- `id` - Unique number (use the next available number)
- `name` - Organization name
- `address` - Street address
- `city` - City name
- `state` - State abbreviation (GA)
- `zipCode` - 5-digit zip code as a string

- `phone` - Phone number in format: (XXX) XXX-XXXX
- `website` - Full URL with https://
- `description` - Clear description of what they offer
- `services` - Array of service types
- `hours` - Operating hours

### Steps to Add a Resource

1. Open `src/data/foodResources.json`
2. Add a new entry at the end of the array (before the closing `]`)
3. Ensure all required fields are included
4. Verify the JSON is properly formatted (use a JSON validator)
5. Save the file

### Verifying Information

Before adding a resource, please:
- âœ… Verify the address and phone number are correct
- âœ… Check the website URL works
- âœ… Confirm the organization is currently operating
- âœ… Include accurate hours of operation

## Code Contributions

### Code Style
- Use functional React components with hooks
- Follow existing code formatting
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep components focused and reusable

### Styling Guidelines
- **Use SCSS/Sass** for all styles
- **Follow BEM naming convention** (Block__Element--Modifier)
  - Example: `.food-resources__card`, `.home__cta-button`
- **Use the global variables** defined in `src/styles/global.scss`
  - Colors: `$primary-color`, `$text-secondary`, etc.
  - Breakpoints: `$breakpoint-md`, `$breakpoint-lg`, etc.
- **Create component-specific SCSS files** (e.g., `ComponentName.scss`)
- **Import styles at the top of each component**
  - Example: `import '../styles/Home.scss';`
